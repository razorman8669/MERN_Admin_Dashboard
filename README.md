# MERN Admin Dashboard

In this repository I will build a complete full stack admin dashboard application using MERN from scratch.

## This application will consist of

* A dashboard page with different stats, a line chart, a transaction table and a pie chart
* A products page with a list of products with rating, description, category and see more button
* A customers page where we have a data table about each customer
* A transaction page with server side pagination
* A geography page that will tell us where users are located

* A line chart that shows the revenue by the month where we can swap from sales to units
* A daily and monthly chart where we can choose different ranges of dates for our daily or monthly sales
* A breakdown pie chart
* An admin chart

## This application will use the following technologies

The MERN stack which included MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS

### Frontend

* nivo for charts
* Material UI for styling
* Material UI Data Grid for data tables
* Redux Toolkit for state management
* Redux Toolkit Query for making API calls
* React Router
* React Date Picker

### Backend

* NodeJS as a runtime
* ExpressJS as a backend framework
* Mongoose for managing our MongoDB
